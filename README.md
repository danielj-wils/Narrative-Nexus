# NarrativeNexus
This project explores the integration of language models (LMs) within video games, specifically focusing on the
generation of dynamic and personalised narratives in a topdown shooter game created using the Unity engine. The primary
aim is to investigate how LMs can be leveraged to enhance
player experiences through real-time narrative generation based
on player behaviour and game metrics. The research adopts a
flexible and unstructured player archetype, allowing for diverse
narrative outputs that are tailored to individual dynamic player
styles.

  The approach involves evaluating narratives generated by two
small language models (SLMs; Phi-3 Mini and Mistral 7B) using
both zero-shot and meta-prompting techniques. These narratives
are assessed through an adapted version of the Narrative Believability Score (NBS-12), termed the Narrative Quality Score
(NQS), to measure the quality, coherence and creativity of the
content produced.

  Key findings indicate that the larger model (Mistral 7B),
generally outperform smaller models in terms of narrative quality
and consistency, especially when employing zero-shot prompting.
The research also highlights the challenges of balancing narrative
creativity with coherence and relevance to game context.

  Overall, this study demonstrates the potential of LMs to
significantly enhance the narrative depth within video games
(and specifically within the Unity game engine), offering valuable
insights for future applications in game develo
